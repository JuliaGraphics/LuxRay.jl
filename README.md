# LuxRay

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SimonDanisch/LuxRay.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SimonDanisch/LuxRay.jl)

I still haven't moved forward on this, as I can't build Cxx.jl.
In theory, a leigthweight wrapper should be very easy to build, as there are just around 5-10 function calls to render a 3D mesh with LuxRay.
